1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem for projects in this course was determining what data structure would be best for taking a file as an input, sorting said file, printing out the contents, and being able to search for a specific element in the file
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The way I approached the problem is by reseraching each data structure and determining which one is best for the problem at hand. I came to a conclusion that a vector data structure would be best for this project because it can accomplish everything we need it to do such as sorting, searching, and printing elements easily.
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Looking back on previous programming assignments and Zybooks really helped out for these two projects. Zybooks in particular was essencial in understanding the various data structures and runtime analysis of each.
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has taught me that even though there may be multiple ways to solve a problem, there definetly exists methods that may be a lot more optimial then others. For example, if I went with Hash Tables for the project instead of Vector data structure, the project would be been much harder to run and program because Hash Tables cannot be sorted while Vectors can.
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
There was a lot of work and code that was written in these projects. Making sure that they were readable by spacing everything, providing inline comments, and making revisions before submitting ensured a very easy to read project.
